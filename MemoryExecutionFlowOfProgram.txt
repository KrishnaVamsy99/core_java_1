1. Compilation		-> javac StudentExample.java
2. run the programm 	-> java StudentExample
3. JVM will tell to class loader to load the Example in method area.
	3.a if static variables are available, then memory will be allocated to static varibles in method area.
	3.b if no static variable are available, then no memory will be allocated
4. Main method will be called.
	4.a main method is a block. so, a java stack frame will be created in Java Stacks for main method. 
	4.b if local variables are present in the program, then memory will be allocated in that respective stack frame with default values
	4.c default values for different data types are:
		4.c.1 int 	-> 0
		4.c.2 float	-> 0.0f
		4.c.3 double 	-> 0.0
		4.c.4 String 	-> null
		4.c.5 boolean 	-> false
	4.d for example, there is a statement in our main method like below
		Student s1 = new Student(101, "Krishna", 80, 75, 95, 100, 60);
	4.e Now, Class Loader will check whether the Student class is available in Method area. if it is not present then Class Loader will
		load Student clas in the method area.
		4.e.1 Now, JVM will check for any static variables available in Student class. if there any static variable then memory will be 
		allocated to static variable in static area
	4.f Now, for the Instance variables default values will be assigned.
	4.g Now, there is a keyword called "new". it will create memory for the instance variables of Student class in the heap memory.
	4.h Now, In Student class, for the instance variables default vaules will assigned.
	4.i Now, Student class constructor will be called. (In the program, we declared parameterized constructor. so, we passed parameters)
	4.j Now, Constructor is a block, a java stack frame will be created in Java Stacks for Student class Constructor.
	4.k Now, we will assign value of local variables will be allocated to present object of instance variables.
	4.l Now, Cursor will come back to constructor calling statement in main method i.e.,"new Student(101, "Krishna", 80, 75, 95, 100, 60);" and Student
	 class java stack frame will be destroyed.
	4.m Now, Student constructor will return the present object address.
	4.n Now, Student s1 = new Student(101,"krishna", 80,75, 95, 100,60); Now, we are storing the address of the present object in variable s1. s1 mustbe
	 	student type because it is returning student's present object address. so, we initialized with Student class data type.
	4.o Now, we can invoke any methods in Student class by using Student class reference variable.
	4.p Now, we have showResults() method in Student class. now we called showResults method by using s1 reference variable.(s1.showResults())
	4.q Now, A stack frame will be created for a showResults() method in Java Stacks.
	4.r Now, It will check any local variables are present. if yes, then it will assign default values to those local variables. if not, it will proceed
		with execution of statements
	4.s Now, inside of our showResults() method, there are no local variables. Now, it will proceed with execution of statements one by one
	4.t Now, if there any method calling statements like findTotalMarks(); then, a stack frame will be created for findTotalMarks in Java Stacks memory.
	4.u Now, again, it will execute the statements in the findTotalMarks method. after executing of findTotalMarks() method,stack frame will bedestroyed
	4.v Now, total = findTotalMarks(); now the value returned from the findTotalMarks() method will be assigned to total instance variable
	4.w Now, findAvg(); a java stack frame will be created in Java Stacks.
	4.x Now, there is a statement in findAvg method ie., float avg1 = findTotalMarks()/5;
	4.y Now, findTotalMarks(); Now again, java stack frame will be created for the findTotalMarks() method in Java Stacks. Now, it will return the total
		of the all 5 subjects(c,cpp,java,python,oracle). After execution of method, cursor will return to findTotalMarks()/5. After that,
		findTotalMarks() stack frame will be destroyed.
	4.z Now, Now, avg1 will store respective value when total marks divided by 5. after that, we are returning the avg1 value.
	4.a.1 Now, findAvg() stack frame in Java Stacks will be destroyed.
	4.b.1 Now, grade = findGrade(); Now, for the findGrade() method, java stack frame will be created in java Stacks.
	4.c.1 Now, float fa = avg; here we are assigning instance varaible avg to local variable fa of type float.
	4.d.1 Now, it will return String value.(please refer the program to understand it properly)
	4.e.1 Now, Now the grade value will be assigned to the grade variable.
	4.f.1 Now, in the program we checked the grade value if it is A+/A/B/C/D/E/F and we are assigning pass/fail to the result instance variable.
	4.g.1 Now, What all are the statement are presents will be executed.
	4.h.1 Now, after execution of showResults() method, showResults() method stack frame will be destroyed in Java Stacks.
5. Now, after executing all the statements in the main method, main() method stack frame will be destroyed.
